## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use Grid with Tailwind CSS. I first set the number of columns to one for mobile and added a break point for larger devices. At larger widths the columns are set to two and the first element is set to span to those columns. Grid then automatically organizes the layout.

```
// grid container
<div class="grid grid-col-1 m-auto md:grid-cols-2">
	<div>Element 1</div> // expand to two columns on larger screens
	<div>Element 2</div>
	<div>Element 3</div>
</div>
```

Also learned how to center a text inside a span to get that effect seen in the design.

```
<span class="text-slate-50 text-3xl font-bold"> &dollar;29 </span>
<span class="text-lightGray/50 h-10 inline-flex align-middle px-1">per month</span>

```
